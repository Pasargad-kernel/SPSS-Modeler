There are occassions that we need to set a global parameter based on a SQL query result. In this situation, you just need to create a SQL node,
Put SQL query and make sure it gets the desired result, create a Set Global node and link it to SQL node.

in Set Global node, pick your field by using 'Pick from the set of available fields' and select one of MEAN, SUM, MIN, MAX, SDEV for it and
then check corresponding checkbox for 'Default oeration(s)'.

You can decide to either 'Clear all globals before executing' or not.
Same thing for 'Display preview of globals created after execution.'. Personally I uncheck it once I get assured that it is working just fine.
